  <p>Hi! My name is Tomasz Okraszewski, and I’m a developer passionate about bringing machines to life and building modern technology solutions to fulfill my professional dreams.</p> <p>I specialize in C# and C++, and I’m currently developing software in the WPF environment using the MVVM pattern. I also have experience creating Android applications in Java, building websites with JavaScript and the React framework, and working with the Qt6 framework.</p> <p>I’m comfortable working across both frontend and backend, integrating APIs, and ensuring complete application functionality. My mission is to create accessible, user-friendly solutions – regardless of the device or the user’s level of ability.</p> </article>
